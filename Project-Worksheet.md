### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- TBD

#### PostMVP 

- TBD

## React Architectural Design

Here you will find our architectural design:

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App (Stateful) | Holds the base of our project and routes via react-router |
| Header (Stateless) | Contains navigation for the app. | 
| Footer (Stateless) | Contains social links, copywrite, as well as contact. | 
| PostWork (Stateful) | Where users can post new works to be held in database. |
| ExistingWorks (Stateless) | Works in databse created by users. |
| PostForm (Stateful) | Where users can post new content to share. |
| SignIn (Stateful) | Form for users to create profiles and sign into existing profiles. |


## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.
